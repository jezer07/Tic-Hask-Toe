# EMURGO Academy Haskell Course: Part I

This repository contains a preconfigured Haskell development environment, allowing you to start coding in Haskell with zero installation using [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/) and a browser-based version of VS Code.

The environment contains a guided Tic-Tac-Toe project, designed as a companion to the first part of EMURGO Academy's Haskell course.

## Launch Environment
[Launch in GitPod](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/jezer07/Tic-Hask-Toe)

## Create Your Environment

1. Fork this repository
2. Copy the link to your new repository and prefix it with "https://gitpod.io/#" in your browser
3. Click `Continue with GitHub` and `Authorize gitpod-io`
4. Wait for the environment to build. This can take a while the first time.
5. Select "VS Code Browser" as your editor.


## Build Your Project

As you attend the live sessions, complete each of the assignments in the `/assignments` directory, making changes to the associated `.hs` files in the `/solutions` directory.

As you complete the assignments, stage, commit and push your changes to Github using the `Source Control` tab in the left panel.
